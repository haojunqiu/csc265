# CSC265 (Enriched Data Structures and Analysis)

This course is about designing, analyzing, and comparing data structures. It covers fundamental ADT (graphs, dictionaries, priority queues, and disjoint sets etc.) and plenty of their corresponding data structures, such as red-black trees, B-trees, AVL trees, hashing, binary heap, binomial heap, Fibonacci heaps, disjoint forests, etc. It covers randomized algorithm, and introduction to lower bounds on problem complexity. It also covers algorithm analysis like worst-case, average-case, amortized complexity, expected worst-case complexity. 

Compared with its regular version CSC263, greater emphasis are placed on proofs, theoretical analysis, and creative problem-solving. In addition, it runs at a faster pace, in greater depth and with more rigour, and with more challenging assignments.

It is definitely the hardest course I have ever taken, but it felt rewarding after complete every assignment. Thank you Prof. Ellen!
